// # [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

// #### Challenge 1: Flavor Selection
// Given a variable that holds a user's preferred type of Monster Energy drink, 
// print whether the user prefers a "Regular" or "Sugar-free" variety. If the preference is not set, default to "Regular".

let preferredFlavor = ""; // Replace with user's preferred flavor like "Regular" or "Sugar-free"

let flavorType = preferredFlavor || "Regular";

if (flavorType === "Regular") {
  console.log("User prefers Regular Monster Energy drink.");
} else if (flavorType === "Sugar-free") {
  console.log("User prefers Sugar-free Monster Energy drink.");
} else {
  console.log("Invalid preference.");
}

// #### Challenge 2: Stock Check
// You have a variable that tracks the number of Monster Energy cans left in the fridge. 
// Use a ternary operator to print "Time to restock!" if the number is less than 5, or "We're stocked!" if the number is 5 or more.

let cansLeft = 3; // Replace with the actual number of cans left

let message = (cansLeft < 5) ? "Time to restock!" : "We're stocked!";
console.log(message);

// #### Challenge 3: Workout Intensity
// Based on the current heart rate, determine if the user should drink a Monster Energy drink to boost their workout. 
// If the heart rate is below 100 bpm, print "Boost needed!", otherwise, print "Energy levels are high!".

let heartRate = 95; // Replace with the current heart rate value

if (heartRate < 100) {
  console.log("Boost needed!");
} else {
  console.log("Energy levels are high!");
}

// #### Challenge 4: Temperature Suitability
// Monster Energy drinks are best served cold. Given the current temperature, use a ternary to print "Chilled to perfection!" 
// if the temperature is below or equal to 5°C, or "Needs a cooler!" if above 5°C.

let temperature = 4;  // Set the temperature
message = (temperature <= 5) ? "Chilled to perfection!" : "Needs a cooler!";
console.log(message);


// #### Challenge 5: Late Night Coding Session
// Determine if it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour.
// If it's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!",
// otherwise, print "Better stick to water."

// Define the current hour in 24-hour format
let currentHour = 22; // Replace with the current hour in 24-hour format

if (currentHour >= 7 && currentHour < 24) {
    console.log("Unleash the beast!");
  } else {
    console.log("Better stick to water.");
  }

// Write your code below this line to determine if it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour
// If it's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!"
// Otherwise, print "Better stick to water."






// In each of these challenges, the ternary operator is used to decide between two options based on a condition, 
// demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic. Remember that while ternaries can make the code more succinct, 
// they should be used judiciously to maintain readability, especially for more complex conditions.
